## Obfuscated Face Reconstruction
Estimating a high-resolution(HR) face image from its low-resolution(LR) counterpart using deep convolutional neural network. And using pretrained image classification model like VGGNet to contruct perceptual loss to obtain photo-realistic reconstruction. Plus, we may implement GAN(generative adversial network) and use LR images as prior info to reconstruct the fine details.
